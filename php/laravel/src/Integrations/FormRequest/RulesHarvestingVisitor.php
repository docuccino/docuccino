/**
 * The shared back half of the two rules-array recoverers — {@see RulesMethodVisitor} for a `rules()`
 * override, {@see InlineRulesVisitor} for an inline `validate()`/`Validator::make()`. It holds the folded
 * fields, the unrecoverable list, and the {@see harvest()} that reads a `['field' => <rule>]` array by
 * constant-folding each value so `Rule::enum(…)`/`Rule::in(…)` descriptors survive PHPStan's collapse to a
 * bare object. Nothing is executed. Subclasses supply only the front matching — which AST node carries the
 * array — via {@see enterNode()}.
 *
 * A field whose value folds to no rules (a closure, an unannotated `new` rule object, `Rule::when(…)`, an
 * unresolvable expression) is recorded as unrecoverable so the caller can diagnose it instead of losing
 * it. A field that folds to SOME of its rules is recorded with what it left out: values it could not read
 * (widened), or whole rules that can only refuse values (unread). A field with a rule whose content is
 * unknown is given up and recorded as opaque, and no other recovery may restate it ({@see ConstValueToRules}).
